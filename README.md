# Printable Mini Cheetah Model

This is a 3D printable version of the [MIT Biomimetic Robotics Lab](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/) mini cheetah.

It is based on the original cad but simplified for ease of printing.

Please consider starring the repo if you find this cool!

Progression is left to right, back to front.

## Printing Instructions

3mf files are available in the directory.  
All objects are released at a 1:1 scale to the real mini cheetah.

You should also print one of the assembly tools to help assemble the leg.

However, we intend for these to be printed at 20% scale.

Please see the 3mf files for correct printing orientation.

## Assembly Instructions
An assembly guide will be released at a later date (as of 2025-06-27).

The recommended procedure is:

1. Assemble each of the `printable_cheetah_leg_link1_x4`, `printable_cheetah_leg_actuator_x4`, and
`printable_cheetah_leg_adapter_x4` using the assembly tool.

2. Connect the `link1` assembly to the `printable_cheetah_leg_link2_x4`.  Make sure to only apply
force along the direction of the links to avoid snapping the joints.  It is recommended to grip
link1 as close to the joint as possible.

3. Connect the leg assembly to `printable_cheetah_abad_x4`.  It helps to rock the joint as you push the links
together

4. Connect the leg-abad assemblies to `printable_cheetah_body_x1`.  Again, make sure to rock the joint back and forth
as you push the links together.

5. Slide the feet on.  Make sure that the feet flanges face to the right and left of the cheetah, rather than forward and backwards.

6. Congrats! You now have a fully articulated mini cheetah model.
