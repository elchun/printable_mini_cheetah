# Printable Mini Cheetah Model

This is a 3D printable version of the [MIT Biomimetic Robotics Lab](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/) mini cheetah.

It is based on the original cad but simplified for ease of printing.

## Printing Instructions

3mf files are available in the directory.  
All objects are released at a 1:1 scale to the real mini cheetah.

However, we intend for these to be printed at 20% scale.

Please see the 3mf files for correct printing orientation.
